### Reasons for building the project :
During the IBM course - Visualizing Data with Python and learning about DASH
I decided to implement a project as practice and learning more.
  Considering the dire weather conditions of the big city of Tehran, and being interested in the topic of implementing various types of maps, I chose the topic of Tehran's air quality index!


### Source of data: 
https://airnow.tehran.ir/home/AQITable.aspx



### Indicators :
Approximately 35 important points of Tehran
by 6 important air quality indicators (CO/O3/NO2/SO2/PM10/PM2.5)
Display information in maps in 5 different types and a table



#### My achievements in this project:
- Practicing Python coding, learning Dash and plotly, implementing map types and connecting to data, learning callbacks, implementing dash_table and other things...


Learning continues ♥
